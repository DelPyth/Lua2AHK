# Lua2AHK
My half-assed attempt at using Lua in AHK.

## Attention...
IT ####ING WORKS. AFTER SO LONG AND BEING SO PISSED ABOUT THIS, IT FINALLY WORKS.

## Info
- **Version**: 2.0.2
- **Bit Size**: 64

# To Do List
- [x] Get `lua.dll` to actually work.
	- Expectation: `lua.dll` will be run and able to execute internal functions within the DLL file.
	- Reality: Fuck it, I tried.
- [x] Execute external Lua script with custom variables and functions taken from AHK itself.
	- Expectation: Variables and Functions can be called and used within the external script.
