# Lua2AHK
My half-assed attempt at using Lua in AHK.

# Call to Arms
I beg of you to help me make this happen. I cannot do this alone as I am inexperienced with executing external functions from a DLL file.

## Info
- **Version**: 1.1.34.4+
- **Type**: Unicode
- **Bit Size**: 64

# To Do List
- [ ] Get `lua.dll` to actually work.
	- Expectation: `lua.dll` will be run and able to execute internal functions within the DLL file.
	- Reality: Fuck it, I tried.
- [ ] Execute external Lua script with custom variables and functions taken from AHK itself.
	- Expectation: Variables and Functions can be called and used within the external script.
